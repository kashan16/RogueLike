## Rust Roguelike

Welcome to the Rust Roguelike project! This is a text-based roguelike game written in the Rust programming language, inspired by classic roguelike games like Nethack and Angband.

### Features:

- **Procedural Generation**: Explore dynamically generated dungeons with each playthrough, ensuring no two adventures are the same.
- **Turn-based Gameplay**: Engage in strategic turn-based combat as you battle monsters, navigate traps, and uncover hidden treasures.
- **Permadeath**: Test your skills in a challenging environment where death is permanent, making every decision critical to your survival.
- **Character Progression**: Customize your character's abilities and equipment as you level up and gain experience throughout your journey.
- **Interactive Environment**: Interact with various objects, including chests, altars, and NPCs, each with their own unique effects and rewards.
- **ASCII Art Graphics**: Immerse yourself in a classic roguelike experience with ASCII art graphics, allowing for lightweight and accessible gameplay.

### Technologies Used:

- **Rust**: Utilize the Rust programming language for its performance, safety, and expressive features.
- **tcod-rs**: Leverage the `tcod-rs` library for handling roguelike-specific functionalities like input handling, display rendering, and field of view calculations.
- **Cargo**: Manage dependencies and build processes using Cargo, Rust's package manager and build system.
- **Git**: Collaborate with contributors and manage version control using Git, ensuring a stable and well-maintained codebase.
